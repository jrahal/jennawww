                    Legalizing and regulating marijuana for recreational purposes presents a bold new landscape for Canadian businesses and governments
                    alike. What this new landscape might look like remains unclear, however, the Federal Task Force charged
                    with informing upcoming legislation on the topic continues to study the issue and meet with stakeholders
                    throughout Canada and abroad, including in those US states where recreational marijuana is already legal.
                    (4)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But why is it illegal in most places and why did it take Canada so long to legalize it? First, it was perceived as highly
                    addictive and historically been linked with Narcotics such as Cocaine and Heroin. Adiitionally, it was
                    associated with bad lifestyles and with oppressed ethnic groups. Marijuana was associated with Mexican-Americans,
                    and a ban on marijuana was seen as a way of discouraging Mexican-American subcultures from developing.

                  <h2>Statistics</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Of adults 26 or older who used marijuana before age 15, 62% went on to use cocaine at some point in their lives; 9% went
                    on to use heroin at least once; and 54% made some nonmedical use of mind-altering prescription drugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The annual cost of enforcing marijuana laws (police and courts): $500 million. Also annual number of arrests for all offences
                    concerning illegal drugs: 90,000
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is also estimated annual costs associated with substance abuse in Canada: $1.4 billion for illegal drugs; $7.5 billion
                    for alcohol and $9.6 billion for tobacco. Finally, the estimated number of marijuana users in Canada:
                     2.3 million (4)

                  <h2>Who is impacted by this topic? </h2>
                  <br>
                  <h3>The Government</h3>
                  <p>
                    The government has to spend less money enforcing laws against marijuana. They also need to spend more money on marijuana
                    sales, and hiring marijuana farmers.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Blackmarket dealers</h3>
                  <p>
                    Blackmarket dealers will be one of the most affected by this topic. They will sell way less Marijuana due to the legal accessibility
                    of the substance. Marijuana users will feel more comfortable purchasing it legally. Most illegal dealers
                    will go out of business.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Current Farmers</h3>
                  <p>
                    Current Marijuana farmers will be able to grow their business exponentially, as they are no longer selling small amounts
                    to underground black market dealers, but in a mass to government officials.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Retailers</h3>
                  <p>
                    Retailers such as Shoppers Drug Mart, Loblaws and the LCBO will want to start incorporating Marijuana in their sales. In
                    doing this, they will gain much more customers and money
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Narcotic manufacturing companies</h3>
                  <p>
                    Companies manufacturing heavy narcotics such as Cocaine, Heroin and morphine will most likely lose a lot of business after
                    their customers have easy access to a better narcotic. People will stop buying hard drugs, and will start
                    buying more marijuana.

                  <h3>Parents and Guardians </h3>
                  <p>
                    Parents are scared that their young children might be exposed to edibles, and may consume them out of curiosity, as they
                    are often displayed in a colourful and fun manner. Parents are also worried about their teenagers and
                    young adults. Currently, the consumption of marijuana is a very common thing among youth and young adults.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>People in need of marijuana </h3>
                  <p>
                    Many people are in need of marijuana to treat medical issues, but are not qualified for a prescription. These people are
                    for the legalization of marijuana to be able to treat their illnesses without the need of a prescription.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h3>Young-adults and teenagers</h3>
                  <p>
                    Young adults are for the legalization of marijuana, because it would be a more accessible and legal way to smoke it without
                    needing a medical reason. Many people like to smoke it for fun, but can’t get a hold of it because it
                    is only available for medical reasons.

                    The Legislative branch is the level of government involved in the legalization of marijuana, as it is a national law, which
                    is the branch that takes care of national laws. The executive branch is also related to this series of
                    laws, as the monarch is in charge of that branch of government. (5)

                    They also want to keep marijuana a safe hobby. They do this by advertising the risks of cannabis to children,

                  <h2>Possible solutions to the problem </h2>
                  <h3>Strict age restrictions on the possession of marijuana</h3>
                  <p>
                    A smart idea to resolve this problem, would be to add strict monitoring on the age restrictions on marijuana. This could
                    be achieved by the addition of extra security and monitoring of pot trafficking. There should be more
                    police monitoring the exchange of marijuana by the underaged.

                  <h3>Restrict the use of colourful, playful design in the packages</h3>
                  <p>
                    To prevent children from becoming curious, or attracted to the packaging, it would make a significance to make the packaging
                    in a plain and monotone fashion as to not attract young children.

                  <h3>Raise awareness on the dangers of Cannabis</h3>
                  <p>
                    In raising awareness on the dangers and consequences of different types of marijuana, it educated the general public on the
                    topic, and it might help instruct them on how to prevent health problems.

                  <p>
                    The possibility that the federal government will legalize and regulate marijuana for recreational purposes presents a bold
                    new landscape for Canadian businesses and governments alike. What this new landscape might look like
                    remains unclear, however, the Federal Task Force charged with informing upcoming legislation on the topic
                    continues to study the issue and meet with stakeholders throughout Canada and abroad, including in those
                    US states where recreational marijuana is already legal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is clear, however, is that regardless of the specifics of how recreational marijuana may ultimately be regulated in
                    terms of distribution, retail, marketing or even the forms the product can be sold in, success in this
                    nascent industry will be predicated upon understanding the current and future consumer. (12)
