        <p class="heading">Restaurant decision maker BlackBerry app</p>
        <p>
          A published BB10 app which helps you decide on where to have your next meal. As a University of Waterloo student, you have access to extra features, such as calculating how much time you have left until your next class, as well as view places that accept the WatCard. You can also check your WatCard balance. The app only shows restaurants that are viable within the time constraints given from your schedule.
